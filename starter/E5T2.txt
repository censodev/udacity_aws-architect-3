# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates

Checkov: It is for analyzing static codes for IaC. To detect cloud misconfigurations, it scans your cloud infrastructure, which is managed in Kubernetes, Terraform, and Cloudformation.
TFLint: A Terraform linter – TFLint is focused on checking possible errors and provides the best security practice.
Terrafirma: Terrafirma is another tool for static code analysis used for Terraform plans.
Accurics: Accurics provides a platform that helps you detect and remediate risks across your cloud infrastructure.
CloudSploit: CloudSploit provides continuous security monitoring and compliance reporting for cloud infrastructure.

Example vulnerabilities: Unsecured credentials, unsecure default configurations could lead to data exposure

##Scan AMI’s or containers for OS vulnerabilities

Falco: Falco is an open-source project and a threat detection engine for Kubernetes. It is a runtime security tool to detect anomalous activity in hosts and containers running on Kubernetes. It detects any unexpected behaviors in your application and alerts you about the threats at runtime.
Atomic CLI: Scans images and uses OpenSCAP to determine security vulnerabilities.
CloudForms: Scans images using OpenSCAP (same as Atomic) and also adds capabilities like taking action when container images are vulnerable, automatically scanning new images and even reporting.
Dagda: Scans for vulnerabilities, Trojans, viruses, and malware in Docker containers.
Dockscan: Scans for security vulnerabilities with a low number of commits.

Example vulnerabilities: Outdated version, trojans, viruses and malware

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities

AWS Config: AWS Config is an effective tool for assessing, evaluating, recording, auditing configurations of the resources in your AWS environment.
Inspector: Inspector is an automated security assessment service that helps improve the security and compliance of applications deployed on AWS.
GuardDuty: GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior to protect your AWS accounts and workloads.
Macie: Macie is a fully managed data security and data privacy service that uses machine learning and pattern matching to discover and protect your sensitive data in AWS.
Security Hub: Security Hub provides a comprehensive view of your high-priority security alerts and compliance status across your AWS accounts.

Example vulnerabilities: weak account credentials/authentication, loose inbound/outbound rules, redundant priviledges/policies provisioning
