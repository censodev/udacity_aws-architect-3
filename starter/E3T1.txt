# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
My GuardDuty did not show any findings although I ran the brute force attack many times.

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
GuardDuty detects the brute force attacks by scanning Amazon VPC Flow Logs for failed login attempts on port 22.
